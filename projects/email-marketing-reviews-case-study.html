            <h3>How we got from new lead gen channel to 45 demos and 249 leads via Linkedin</h3>

<hr />

<h4>Initial Approach</h4>


    <p>We had two un-engaged email lists</p>
    
    <p>The customer email list had 13K contacts and Leads email list had only 1,500 contacts.</p>

    <p>People on both the lists had not received an email in 10 months.</p>

    <p>There was no email automation set up in the place</p>

    <p>The client wanted immediate results.</p>

<hr />

<h4>My Strategy</h4>

<p>Based on the number of contacts in the customer email list, we decided to use that first.</p>
<p>Now, these people had already used our client’s services, and most of the time, it is a one-time service. So these people couldn’t be repeat buyers</p>
<p>With this in mind, we decided to use the customer email list to get more reviews for our client on Google, Yelp, and Trustpilot.</p>
<p>We created a Review Email Sequence and started sending it out in batches.</p>



<hr />

<h4>The Results</h4>

<p>We launched the Review Email Sequence to 5,000 contacts initially.</p>
<p>Within the first 24 hours, we got 54 new, unsolicited, genuine reviews on Google alone!</p>
<p>We bagged 19 reviews on Yelp and Trustpilot in the first 24 hours. Boom!</p>
<p>The results didn’t slow down until the 3rd day, and we got over a hundred reviews in total with just one email.</p>
<p>Email open rate on the first email was 35% along with a CTR of 7.21%</p>
<p>We didn’t stop there and had automation in place.</p>
<p>People who had opened the email but didn’t review were sent a follow-up email</p>
<p>The contacts who had not opened the email at all were sent a separate email follow up.</p>
<p>The email open rate on the 2nd email was 68.09% with 8.04% CTR.</p>
<p>People who had opened the email clicked the links, and didn’t submit the review were followed up with a separate email</p>
<p>By the end of our Review Email Sequence, we bagged 159 reviews in total on Google, Yelp, and Trustpilot.</p>
